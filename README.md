## A [Small Web](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development) server.

NodeKit is a web server with an integrated application framework that makes web development _even easier_ than it was in the early days.

Enjoy build-free web development with a modern stack built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [experimental ESM loaders](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/esm.html#loaders), [NodeScript](#nodescript) (a superset of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)), and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

_Because creating a modern web site should be simple if your aim isn‚Äôt to do something nasty to people._

## System requirements

  - Node 16.x+ LTS.
  - Linux

### For deployment:

  - systemd

## Install

  1. Clone this repository

      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/small-tech/nodekit.git
      ```

  2. Switch to the NodeKit directory.

      ```shell
      cd nodekit
      ```

  3. Install.

      ```shell
      ./install
      ```

## Getting started

You can run NodeKit using the following syntax:

```shell
nodekit [path to serve]
```

During development, you can also run NodeKit from the source folder like this:

```shell
bin/nodekit [path to serve]
```

> üí° By default, NodeKit will be as quiet as possible in the console and only surface warnings and errors.
>
> If you want more extensive logging, you can start it with the VERBOSE environment variable set:
>
> `VERBOSE=true nodekit [path to serve]`
>
> or
>
> `VERBOSE=true bin/nodekit [path to serve]`
>
> Similarly, if you want to see performance statistics, set `PROFILE=true`.

## Examples

The best way to get started is to play with the examples.

  - Hello Count: `examples/hello-count`
  - Persisted Hello Count: `examples/persisted-hello-count`
  - Simple Chat: `examples/simple-chat`
  - Make Fetch Happen: `examples/make-fetch-happen`
  - Streaming Fediverse Posts: `examples/streaming-fediverse-posts`
  - Non-SSR Svelte Compiled Component Workaround (Particles): `examples/non-ssr-svelte-compiled-component-workaround-particles`

e.g., to launch the Simple Chat example, run:

```shell
nodekit examples/simple-chat
```

## Tutorials

### Hello, world!

Let‚Äôs quickly create and test your first ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù NodeKit site.

Create a file called `index.page` and add the following content to it:

```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```

Now run `nodekit`, hit _https://localhost_, and you should see your new site.

Yes, NodeKit will happily serve any HTML you throw at it just like any other good web server should. The only catch is you need to put it into a `.page` file.

> If you have static assets you want to serve, put them in a special folder called _#static_. In fact, we _could_ have put our HTML into _#static/index.html_ and the outcome would have been identical.

But you can render HTML using any web server‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs do something that no other web server can do now, shall we?

### Counting hellos.

Change your _index.page_ to read:

```html
<data>
  let count = 1

  export default () => {
    return {count: count++}
  }
</data>

<script>
  export let data
</script>

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve greeted you {data.count} times.</p>
```

Now run `nodekit` and refresh the page to see the counter increase.

‚ú® Ooh, magic! ‚ú®

> #### How does it work?
>
> A page in NodeKit is written in [NodeScript](#nodescript), which is a superset of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
>
> In addition to what Svelte can do, NodeScript gives you the ability to add server-side code to your pages in a `<data>` block.
>
> The default function you export from it is evaluated every time the route is requested and anything it returns is injected into the `data` variable you exported from your `<script>` block.
>
> The rest of the example is simply client-side Svelte.
>
> ___If you haven‚Äôt done so already, now would be a good time to work through the entire [Svelte Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics). It‚Äôs rather excellent. Go ahead, I‚Äôll wait‚Ä¶___

### Persistence is the secret to success (or something)

So counting stuff is great but what happens if you restart the server?

Your count is lost! (This is a tragedy.)

So let‚Äôs fix that.

(Brace yourself, you‚Äôre about to use ‚Äì _drumroll_ ‚Äì a SCARY database! _Oooh!_)

> ## üëª Scared yet?

Update your code to match this:

```html
<data>
  if (db.greetings === undefined) {
    db.greetings = { count: 1 }
  }

  export default () => {
    return {count: db.greetings.count++}
  }
</data>

<script>
  export let data
</script>

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve greeted you {data.count} times.</p>
```

Now load the page, refresh, stop the server, restart it, and load the page‚Ä¶

__Wait, what?__

__That‚Äôs _it?___

__Seriously?__

Yep, that‚Äôs the magic of the integrated JavaScript Database (JSDB) in NodeKit.

If you don‚Äôt believe me, restart the server and note that the count is still there.

If you _still_ don‚Äôt believe me (wow, what a cynic), open the _.db/greetings.js_ table in a text editor and take a look. You should see something like this:

```js
export const _ = { 'count': 18 };
_['count'] = 19;
_['count'] = 20;
```

That‚Äôs what a table looks like in JavaScript Database (JSDB), which is integrated into NodeKit and available to all your routes via a global `db` reference.

Yes, you need never fear persistence ever again.

There‚Äôs so much more to JSDB that you can learn about in [the JSDB documentation](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb#readme).

## Make Fetch Happen

While you can import any Node module that you install in your app from within the data block of your pages, there are are commonly used global APIs that you can use without importing. You saw one of those, the JavaScript Database (JSDB), above, that‚Äôs available as `db`. Similarly, the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is available for use from your data blocks as `fetch`.

Here‚Äôs an example of how to use the Fetch API to get the list of public posts from a [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance.

This is the instance we‚Äôll be using: https://mastodon.ar.al

And this is the JSON endpoint with the public timeline data: https://mastodon.ar.al/api/v1/timelines/public

Take a look at both to understand what we‚Äôre working with before creating a new folder called _make-fetch-happen_ with a file called _index.page_ in it. Then add the following code to that file:

```svelte
<data>
  export default async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://mastodon.ar.al/api/v1/timelines/public')
    return await response.json()
  }
</data>

<script>
  export let data
</script>

<h1>Aral‚Äôs Fediverse Public Timeline</h1>
<ul>
  {#each data as post}
    <li>
      <a class='avatar-link' href='{post.account.url}'>
        <img class='avatar' src='{post.account.avatar}' alt='{post.account.username}‚Äôs avatar'>
      </a>
      <div class='content'>
        {@html post.content}
        {#each post.media_attachments as media}
          {#if media.type === 'image'}
            <img class='image' src='{media.url}'>
          {/if}
        {/each}
      </div>
    </li>
  {/each}
</ul>

<style>
  :global(body) { font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1.25em; }
  :global(p:first-of-type) { margin-top: 0; }
  :global(p) { line-height: 1.5; }
  :global(a:not(.avatar-link)) {
    text-decoration: none; background-color: rgb(139, 218, 255);
    border-radius: 0.25em; padding: 0.25em; color: black;
  }
  h1 { font-size: 2.5em; text-align: center; }
  li {
    display: flex; align-items: flex-start; column-gap: 1em; padding: 1em;
    margin-bottom: 1em; background-color: #ccc; border-radius: 1em;
  }
  .avatar { width: 8em; border-radius: 1em; }
  .content { flex: 1; }
  .image { max-width: 100%; }
</style>
```

Now, run Nodekit with:

```shell
nodekit make-fetch-happen
```

And hit _https://localhost_ to see the latest public timeline from Aral‚Äôs mastodon instance.

> üíæ This example is available in _examples/make-fetch-happen_. You can also find a version that demonstrates importing a third-party module called [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) and using that instead in _examples/_third-party-import-in-nodescript-node-fetch_.

> üíæ There‚Äôs also version of this example that implements a streaming timeline in _examples/streaming-fediverse-posts_.

> üí° Fetch is not a native part of Node.js yet but it will be soon. NodeKit currently includes [undici‚Äôs](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) [fetch implementation](https://github.com/nodejs/undici#undicifetchinput-init-promise). This is [in the process of being included in Node.js core.](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41749). Once it is, NodeKit will simply remove the third-party library and replace the reference with the internal one and your apps should continue to work as before.
>
> If you notice any issues with the fetch functionality, please report them on [undici‚Äôs issue tracker](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues) and you will help make Node.js and NodeKit better in the process. (Thank you.)

## NodeScript

With NodeKit, you write your apps using NodeScript.

NodeScript is a superset of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) that includes support for server-side rendering and simple data exchange between the client and the server.

## APIs and working with data

For many projects, you should be able to keep your both your client and server code in the same `.page` file using NodeScript.

However, if you have an API or purely data-related routes, you can create server-side routes by creating files with any valid HTTP1/1.1 method lowercased as the file extension (i.e., `.get`, `.post`, `.patch`, `.head`, etc.)

Also, you can create a WebSocket route simply by creating a `.socket` file.

e.g.,

```text
my-project
  ‚îú index.page
  ‚îú index.post
  ‚îú about
  ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞ index.page
  ‚îú todos
  ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞ index.get
  ‚ï∞ chat
     ‚ï∞ index.socket
```

Optionally, to organise larger projects, you can encapsulate your site within a `src` folder. If a `src` folder does exist, NodeKit will only serve routes from that folder and not from the project root.

e.g.,

```text
my-project
  ‚îú src
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú index.page
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú index.post
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú index.socket
  ‚îÇ  ‚ï∞ about
  ‚îÇ      ‚ï∞ index.page
  ‚îú test
  ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞ index.js
  ‚ï∞ README.md
```

## Valid file types

NodeKit doesn‚Äôt force you to put different types of routes into predefined folders. Instead, it uses file extensions to know how to handle different routes and other code and assets.

Here is a list of the main file types NodeKit handles and how it handles them:

| Extension | Type | Behaviour |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| .page     | NodeKit page (supports NodeScript) | Compiled into HTML and served in response to a HTTP GET request for the specified path. |
| .get, .head, .patch, .options, .connect, .delete, .trace, .post, .put | HTTP route | Served in response to an HTTP request for the specified method and path. |
| .socket | WebSocket route | Served in response to a WebSocket request for the specified path. |
| .component | Svelte component | Ignored by router. |
| .svelte | Svelte component (.component is just an alias for .svelte) | Ignored by router. |
| .js | Javascript module | Ignored by router. |

## HTTP routes

HTTP data routes are served in response to an HTTP request for the specified method and path.

All HTTP request methods are supported.

You create an HTTP route by create a JavaScript file named with the HTTP request method you want to respond to.

For example, to respond to GET requests at `/books`, you would create a file named `books.get` in the root of your source folder.

The content of HTTP routes is an ESM module that exports a standard Node route request handler that takes [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) and [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) arguments.

For example, your `books.get` route might look like this:

```js
export default (request, response) => {
  const books = db.books.get()
  response.end(books)
}
```

## WebSocket routes

WebSocket routes are defined in files ending with the `.socket` extension.

They resemble HTTP routes but get the socket passed in as an extra initial parameter.

For example, here‚Äôs a basic _echo.socket_ route that repeats whatever it receives back to you:

```js
export default (socket, request, response) => {
  socket.addEventListener('message', event => {
    socket.send(event.data)
  })
}
```

> üí° Since we‚Äôre not using the `request` or `response` objects in this route, we could have just left them off of the function signature.

And a simple _index.page_ route that uses it:

```svelte
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte'

  let messageField

  let socket
  let message = ''
  let messages = []

  onMount(() => {
    // Initialise the web socket
    socket = new WebSocket(`wss://localhost/echo`)

    socket.addEventListener('open', event => {
      socket.send('Hello, there!')
    })

    socket.addEventListener('message', event => {
      messages = [...messages, event.data]
    })
  })
</script>

<h1>WebSocket Echo Demo</h1>

<form id='messageForm' on:submit|preventDefault={event => {
  socket.send(message)
  message = ''
  messageField.focus()
}}>
  <label>Message:
    <input type='text' bind:this={messageField} bind:value={message}>
  </label>
  <button type='submit'>Send</button>
</form>

<h2>Received messages</h2>

<ul id='received'>
  {#each messages as message}
    <li>{message}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

## Database

NodeKit has an integrated [JSDB](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb) database that‚Äôs available from all your routes as `db`.

JSDB is a transparent, in-memory, streaming write-on-update JavaScript database for the Small Web that persists to a JavaScript transaction log.

If you‚Äôve created at least one table on the database, you can find it in the `.db` folder. Tables in JSDB are simply JavaScript objects or arrays and JSDB writes to plain old JavaScript files.

[Learn more about JSDB.](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb)

## Route parameters

You can include route parameters in your route paths by separating them with underscores and surrounding the parameter names in square brackets.

For example:

```text
manage_[token]_[domain].socket
```

Will create a WebSocket endpoint at:

```text
/manage/:token/:domain
```

You can also intersperse path fragments with parameters:

```text
books_[id]_pages_[page].page
```

Will compile the NodeKit page and make it available for HTTP GET requests at:

```text
/books/:id/pages/:page
```

So you can access the route via, say, `https://my.site/books/3/pages/10`.

You can also specify the same routes using folder structures. For example, the following directory structure will result in the same route as above:

```text
my-site
  ‚ï∞ books
     ‚ï∞ [id]
         ‚ï∞ pages
             ‚ï∞ [page].page
```

Note that you could also have set the name of the page to `index_[page].page`. Using just `[page].page` for a parameterised index page is a shorthand.

You can decide which strategy to follow based on the structure of your app. If, for example, you could access not just the pages but the references and images of a book, it might make sense to use a folder structure:

```text
my-site
  ‚ï∞ books
     ‚ï∞ [id]
         ‚îú pages
         ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞ [page].page
         ‚îú references
         ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞ [reference].page
         ‚ï∞ images
             ‚ï∞ [image].page
```

You may, or may not find that easier to manage than:

```text
my-site
  ‚îú books_[id]_pages_[page].page
  ‚îú books_[id]_references_[reference].page
  ‚ï∞ books_[id]_images_[image].page
```

NodeKit leaves the decision up to you.


## Multiple roots

For larger projects, you might want to organise your routes, say, to separate your pages from your API. You can specify any folder within your source to be a new route by prefixing its name with an octothorpe (hash symbol/`#`).

For example, you can split the following directory structure:

```unicode
my-project
  ‚îú index.page
  ‚îú contacts.page
  ‚ï∞ contacts.post
```

As:

```unicode
my-project
  ‚îú index.page
  ‚ï∞ #api
    ‚îú contacts.page
    ‚ï∞ contacts.post
```

Or even:

```unicode
my-project
  ‚îú #pages
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú index.page
  ‚îÇ   ‚ï∞ contacts.page
  ‚ï∞ #api
      ‚ï∞ contacts.post
```

In all of the above versions, HTTP GET calls to `/contacts` will find `contacts.page` and HTTP POST calls to `/contacts` will find `contacts.post`.

_(If you wanted your `contacts.post` route to be accessible from `/api/contacts` instead, you would just remove the `#` and make it a regular folder.)_

## Static files

If you want NodeKit to serve static files, put them in a special folder called `#static`. This is a special case of the multiple roots feature explained above, where any files (excluding _dotfiles_) are served as static elements.

For example:

```unicode
my-project
  ‚îú index.page
  ‚ï∞ #static
    ‚îú header.svg
    ‚ï∞ demo.mp4
```

## Command-line interface

### serve

Default command.

> üí° `nodekit serve [path to serve]` and `nodekit [path to serve]` are equivalent.

Note that if do not specify a path to serve, the default directory (`./`) is assumed.

### --version

Displays the version number.

_Currently does not exit the process unless when run from the distribution build._

## Building NodeKit

To build a distribution bundle for NodeKit, run:

```shell
./build
```

You will find the distribution under the `dist/` folder.

To run NodeKit from the distribution folder, use the following syntax:

```shell
./nodekit [path to serve]
```

> üí° It‚Äôs usually easier just to run `bin/nodekit [path to serve]` without building or, to test the distribution build, the `./quick-install` script as that will run build for you and install the nodekit command into your path so you can run it as `nodekit [path to serve]`

## Debugging

To run NodeKit with the Node debugger (`node --inspect`), start it using:

```shell
bin/nodekit-inspect [path to serve]
```

> üí° If you use VSCodium, you can add breakpoints in your code and attach to the process using the Attach command in the Run and Debug panel.

## Testing

Tests are written in [tape-with-promises](https://github.com/small-tech/tape-with-promises). Coverage is provided by [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8).

Run tests:

```shell
npm -s test
```

Run coverage:

```shell
npm run -s coverage
```

# How things will be

> ## __‚ö†Ô∏è This section is aspirational. Please treat it as a _design document_.__ More than likely _nothing in this section will work as stated._ Please _DO NOT_ file any bugs about anything in this section.

__TODO: Only one of these lists should exist. Prune/edit as necessary.__

## System requirements

  - Node 16.x+ LTS.
  - For development: Linux
  - For deployment: Linux with systemd

## Core design decisions

  - A server.
  - Node.js only.
  - No build step.
  - No scaffolding/project generators.
  - Runs on both development and production.
  - < 60 seconds to get started in both development and production.
  - Optimise for server-side rendering.
  - TLS everywhere by default.
  - File-based router that uses (experimental) ES Module Loaders.
  - Integrated database as first-class citizen.
  - Convention over configuration.
  - Forgiving (will render a simple static HTML file if you want).
  - Own scripting syntax (NodeScript) for pages that extends Svelte to make it trivial to include data from your database in your server-side rendered pages.
  - Integrated git server for deployments and app auto updates.

## Features

  - Single-line install on development/staging/production.
  - Always uses latest Node.js LTS (you don‚Äôt need to have Node.js installed).
  - Automatic TLS (https) on development/staging/production.
  - NodeScript, a superset of Svelte, lets you define your pages, including server-side data fetching for automatic client-side hydration.
  - Use any svelte component in your interfaces.
  - File-based routing made as elegant and flexible as possible using Node ES Module loaders.
  - Integrated database ([JSDB](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb)).
  - Simple data exchange and server-side rendering (REST and WebSockets).
  - No scaffolding (no `npm init my-project-template`, just start, it‚Äôs easy).
  - No build stage.
  - Integrated git server for deployments and app auto updates.
  - Small as possible in size and dependencies.
  - As opinionated as possible.
  - Deploy on any VPS (e.g., using [Domain](https://github.com/small-tech/domain)) or own your own hardware (e.g., a Raspberry Pi).

## Install

```shell
  wget -qO- https://nodekit.small-web.org/install | bash
```

The NodeKit installer installs two files onto your system. The first is the NodeKit bundle. This is a JavaScript file that contains NodeKit. The other is the version of Node.js [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) that it has been tested with (this will be kept current with the latest LTS release).

___NoteKit has one prerequisite:__ if you want to deploy to a production machine or if you want to update NodeKit itself, you must have a recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system. Needless to say, in the 2020s, most developers will already have a machine that meets this requirement and NodeKit will warn you if you don‚Äôt and prompt you to install it._

## Update

To update NodeKit to the latest version:

  - __In development,__ run:
    ```shell
    nodekit update
    ```
  - __On production,__ you don‚Äôt have to do anything as NodeKit will automatically update itself and its companion Node.js binary as and when necessary.

## Examples

> Note: using third-party Svelte components in NodeKit is sketchy at the moment
> ([see this](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6584)).
> The last example should work but it uses a roundabout way to instantiate the
> component. The first two examples may or may not work depending on the state
> of the main branch as I‚Äôm experimenting with different ways to support this
> use case as we speak.

  - Non-SSR Svelte Source Component (Boring Avatars): `examples/non-ssr-svelte-source-component-boring-avatars`
  - Non-SSR Svelte Source Component (Tree): `examples/non-ssr-svelte-source-component-tree`
  - Non-SSR Svelte Compiled Component Workaround (Particles): `examples/non-ssr-svelte-compiled-component-workaround-particles`

## To do or not to do?

__THIS EXAMPLE IS INCOMPLETE AND OUTDATED: FIX OR REMOVE__

Let‚Äôs create a server-side rendered, dynamic to-do list web app:

1. You‚Äôve already seen that NodeKit does not require scaffolding. Just create a folder and start building your site or app:

    ```shell
    mkdir todo
    cd todo
    touch index.page
    ```

2. Open _index.page_ in your editor and add the following code into it:

    ```svelte
    <data>
      export default (request, response) => {
        return db.todos
      }
    </data>

    <post>
      export default (request, response) => {
        db.todos.push(request.params.todo)
        request.end()
      }
    </post>

    <script>
      export let data
    </script>

    <ul>
      {#each data.todo as todo, index}
        <li>
          <label>
            <input type='checkbox' value={todo.description}>
          </label>
        </li>
      {/each}
    </ul>

    <label>New todo:</label>
    <textarea />
    <button>Add</button>
    ```

3. Run NodeKit.

    ```shell
    nodekit
    ```

Hit https://localhost and you will see your new NodeKit app. Go ahead and add some todos and check them off and reload the page to see them persist.

Take a moment to let it sink in that with just the above code, we created an app that:

  - Is server-side rendered with the latest list of to-dos from a database.
  - Is hydrated on the client and updates the list of to-dos every minute.
  - Enables you to add and check off to-dos and persists them in the database.
  - Includes all the server and client side code in a single file.

We were able to do all that mainly thanks to NodeKit‚Äôs use of [NodeScript](#nodescript), which extends [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) to make creating server-side rendered applications as simple as possible, the integrated [JavaScript Database (JSDB)](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb), and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), which is working behind the scenes to bundle the client-side hydration scripts.

If you want to learn more about the inner workings of NodeKit, look at the list of its [core dependencies](#core-dependencies) in the [Technical Design](#technical-design) section.

## Valid file types

In addition to the ones already implemented:

| Extension | Type | Behaviour |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| .data     | A server-side data handler for a page | A handler that is called on the server while a page is being server-side rendered. Its return value is set as the `data` prop of the page. |


## Layouts

It‚Äôs common to want a shared header and footer on pages on the same site (or in different sections of a site). You can control the layout of your pages using `.layout` files.

| File name | Type | Behaviour |

## Data routes

A generic HTTP route that returns some piece of data is generally considered to be part of your site‚Äôs Application Programming Interface (API).

Generic API routes are useful when the same route is going to be called from the browser by a number of different pages.

But what if you wanted to get the list of books from your database just to render them in your Books page?

For that use case you, can create a `.data` file, which is essentially an HTTP GET route for data that is tightly coupled to a single page.

__books.data__
```js
export default (request, response) => {
  const books = db.books.get()
  return {books}
}
```

__books.page__

```svelte
<script>
  export let data

  setInterval(() => {
    // Refresh the list of books every minute.
    data = await (await fetch('/books/data')).json()
  }, 60000)
</script>

<h1>Books</h1>
<ul>
  {#each data.books as book}
    <li><a href='{book.link}'>{book.title}</a></li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

Note that the data route is almost identical to the HTTP GET route. The main difference is that unlike regular request handlers, which call `response.end()`, your data handler shares the same path as a page (which is rendered in response to a HTTP GET request) and so your data handler must `return` its value.

(You cannot end the response in your GET handler as NodeKit still needs to take the data you‚Äôve returned and render the page.)

## Pages

A NodeKit page is written in NodeScript, which is an extension of Svelte.

Specifically, NodeScript extends Svelte to enable you to easily server-side render your routes. As pages are being rendered, you can, for example, get data from the integrated [JSDB](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb) database and include it in the rendered page. Once the page is rendered, if JavaScript is available on the client, the page will be hydrated.

While you can define your [HTTP routes](#http-routes) in separate files, you can also define them inline, right inside your pages.

So, for example, instead of a separate `books.get` route, your `books.page` could look like this:

```svelte
<data>
  export default (request, response) => {
    const books = db.books.get()
    return {books}
  }
</data>

<script>
  export let data

  setInterval(() => {
    // Refresh the list of books every minute.
    data = await (await fetch('/books/data')).json()
  }, 60000)
</script>

<h1>Books</h1>
<ul>
  {#each data.books as book}
    <li><a href='{book.link}'>{book.title}</a></li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

In the above example, when someone hits `/books`:

1. The `get` handler will run and retrieve a list of the books from the integrated database. (The reference to `db` is globally accessible from all routes.)

2. While the page is being rendered, the value of `data` will have the value returned from the `get` route.

3. As the page is being rendered, the value of data will be used to display the list of books in the unordered list.

Once the page has loaded, it will be hydrated and the script in the `<script>` tag will run in the browser, setting up an interval that will refresh the list of books every minute.

Note that when doing the `fetch` request, we specify `/books/data` as the URL. This is an automatically generated HTTP GET route that you can call for exactly this sort of purpose.

Also note that the behaviour of inline data request handlers is the same as for the external ones.

## Database

In addition to the already implemented features:

NodeKit supports [migrations](#migrations) on the integrated database.

## Migrations

__TODO: Migrations are currently not supported in JSDB.__

The integrated [JSDB](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb) database supports migrations.

A migration is simply a JavaScript file with a `.migration` extension.

The naming convention is:

`version-N.migration`

Where `N` is the database version you are defining. `N` starts at zero (for the initial database setup and increases by 1 each time).

NodeKit will run your migrations in order and update the `version` property of the database accordingly.

## Middleware

NodeKit supports Connect-style middleware. All you have to do is define your middleware in a JavaScript file with a `.middleware` extension.

For example, to allow all Cross Origin Requests (CORS), save the following middleware in a file called `allow-all-cors.middleware` anywhere in your project (that‚Äôs not in the `#static` folder):

```js
module.exports = (request, response, next) => {
  response.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
  response.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept')
  next()
}
```

## The HTML Template

__Tentative: THIS FEATURE MIGHT BE REMOVED.__

By default, NodeKit uses a very basic outermost HTML template and expects you to use [layouts](#layouts) and the <a href='https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_head'>&lt;svelte:head&gt;</a> element to inject anything you might need into `document.head`.

That said, you can override this template by providing a `Layout.html` in your main source folder.

When creating a custom Layout template, you must include the special placeholders that tell NodeKit where to include different parts of a page.

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang='en'>
<head>
  <meta charset='UTF-8'>
  <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
  <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'>
  <link rel="icon" href="data:,">
  <title>{title}</title>
  <style>{css}</style>
</head>
<body>
  {page}
</body>
</html>
```

## Build

_Just kidding._ NodeKit does not have a build stage. It is a server you run on both on your development machine and in production.

NodeKit will automatically build and rebuild things as and when necessary. You don‚Äôt have to worry about it. It‚Äôs really how web development should be.

## Production

Setting up a production server is almost easy as running NodeKit on your development machine.

### Prerequisites:

  1. [systemd](https://systemd.io/)
  1. Either [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) (so you can download the installer)
  2. A recent version of [git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Process:

On your production machine (a VPS works well for this):

  1. [Install NodeKit.](#installation)
  2. Start the server as a service:
     ```shell
     nodekit enable
     ```
  3. Hit your server‚Äôs domain in the browser.

_Note the server password you‚Äôre shown when your server starts in your password manager (e.g., 1password) as you will need it later when [deploying to your server](#deployment)._

The `enable` command runs NodeKit as a systemd service on your server.

Once NodeKit is running as a service, it will automatically restart should your app or server crash.

NodeKit will also periodically check for updates to itself.

## Other prerequisites (common to setting up any server) and how to avoid them

Setting up any production machine involves the following non-trivial prerequisites:

  - commissioning a server (e.g., a VPS or running off your own hardware, which could be a Raspberry Pi)
  - registering a domain name
  - setting up your DNS information to point your domain name to your server

If you want to get up and running with a NodeKit production machine in under a minute, you can set one up on [small-web.org](https://small-web.org).

You can also run [Domain](https://github.com/small-tech/domain) ‚Äì the same software that powers [small-web.org](https://small-web.org) ‚Äì yourself. Some ideas:

  - Run a private instance for your family or maybe the school or other organisation you work for.
  - Run a non-commercial instance for a municipality or other community.
  - Run a commercial service open to the public at large.

If you do use, enjoy, and benefit from NodeKit and/or Domain, please consider becoming [a patron of Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org/fund-us) to enable us to keep working on them.

## Deployment

Once your production server is up and running, you need some way to deploy your application to it.

With NodeKit, you deploy your application using Git.

### Using git directly

Add your production site‚Äôs git repository as your production remote in git.

For example, say you‚Äôre hosting it on small-web.org and your project/domain is called `your-project`. To deploy:

```shell
git remote add production https://your-project.small-web.org/source/self.git
git push production main
```

Before allowing you to push, NodeKit will ask you for your server‚Äôs password.

You can get your servers password by running the following command on your server:

```shell
nodekit password
```

(If you used Domain to set up your server, you should have been shown your password during the setup process. Please store your server‚Äôs password in a password manager like 1password.)

### Using NoteKit‚Äôs aliases

If you like, you can also declare your production remote and deploy using a couple of aliases NodeKit provides to save you a few keystrokes:

```shell
nodekit remote add your-project.small-web.org
nodekit deploy
```

Once you‚Äôve defined your git remote (either directly via git, or via NodeKit), you can use the `nodekit deploy` alias to carry out a `git push production main`.

## Setting up a production server with pull updates

When setting up a production server, you can ask that it regularly polls for source changes on a public git remote.

You would do this if you want other people to be able to deploy your app using NodeKit and/or Domain and get auto updates whenever you make a new release.

When you push updates to your repository, their instances will get automatically updated the next time they poll your repository for changes.

_(Using [Domain](https://github.com/small-tech/domain), anyone can install any NodeKit app simply by providing its URL.)_


## Technical design

NodeKit is an ESM-only project for Node.js and relies on (the currently experimental) [ES Module Loaders](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/esm.html#esm_loaders) ([follow the latest work](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders)) functionality.

Additionally, NodeKit relies on a number of core dependencies for its essential features.

## Core dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| [@small-tech/https](https://github.com/small-tech/https) | Drop-in replacement for Node‚Äôs native https module with automatic TLS for development and production using [@small-tech/auto-encrypt ](https://github.com/small-tech/auto-encrypt) and [@small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost](https://github.com/small-tech/auto-encrypt-localhost). |
| [@small-tech/jsdb](https://github.com/small-tech/jsdb) | Zero-dependency, transparent, in-memory, streaming write-on-update JavaScript database that persists to JavaScript transaction logs. |
| [Polka@next](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) | Native HTTP server with added support for routing, middleware, and sub-applications. Polka uses [Trouter](https://github.com/lukeed/trouter) as its router. |
| [tinyws](https://github.com/tinyhttp/tinyws) | WebSocket middleware for Node.js based on ws. |
| [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)| Interface framework. NodeScript, used in Pages, is an extension of Svelte. Components, used in Pages, are Svelte components. |
| [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) | An extremely fast JavaScript bundler. Used to bundle hydration scripts and NodeScript routes during server-side rendering. |
| [node-git-server](https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/node-git-server) | Git server for hosting your source code. Used in deployments. |
| [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org/) | Git client used in deployments on development and for handling auto-updates on production.|
| [sade](https://github.com/lukeed/sade) | A small command-line interface (CLI) framework that uses [mri](https://github.com/lukeed/mri) for its argument parsing. |

## Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What about serverless?

Dude, this is literally a server. If you want ‚Äúserverless‚Äù (funny how folks who own servers want you to go serverless, isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs almost like a small group of people get to own stuff and you have to rent from them on their terms‚Ä¶ hmm ü§îÔ∏è) then use some Big Tech framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev). They will bend over backwards to cater to all your Big Tech needs.

### Can you add &lt;insert Big Tech feature here&gt;?

No, go away.

### Will this scale?

Fuck off.

(Yes, it will scale for the purposes it was designed for. It will not scale for the purposes of farming the population for their data and destroying our human rights and democracy in the process. That‚Äôs a feature, not a bug.)

### Is there anything stopping me from using this to build sites or apps that violate people‚Äôs privacy and farm them for their data? (You know, the business model of Silicon Valley‚Ä¶ that thing we call surveillance capitalism?)

No, there is nothing in the license to stop you from doing so.

But I will fucking haunt you in your nightmares.

(Just sayin‚Äô)

Also, it‚Äôs not nice. Don‚Äôt.

### Are these really frequently asked questions or a political statement?

Can‚Äôt it be both?

(It‚Äôs a political statement.)
