  <h4>You’re all set!</h4>
  <p>You do not need to set up a payment method to use Basil. When no payment method is set, all server deployments must be done here, from the administrator. You still need to set up the DNS and VPS settings. This is a good option if you just want to set up servers for yourself or for you and your family and friends, for example.</p>
