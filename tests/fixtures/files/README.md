# Files test fixture

This fixture is a snapshot of the [Domain](https://github.com/small-tech/domain) project with its .git, node_modules, etc., folders removed. (A couple of node_modules are kept to ensure theyâ€™re not accidentally picked up.)

The goal is to have a real-world file structure but not bloat the NodeKit repository by including the full project.
